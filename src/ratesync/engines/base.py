"""Base classes and interfaces for rate limiter stores.

This module provides common utilities and base classes that can be
used by different store implementations.
"""


# Future backend-specific base classes can be added here
# For example:
# - KeyValueBackend (for Redis, NATS KV, etc.)
# - DatabaseBackend (for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
# - MemoryBackend (for in-memory/local rate limiting)
